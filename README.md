# Horiseon website: Code Refactor

## Description:

The challenge was to refactor the code of the Horiseon website to improve accessability standards. The html and css files have been modified to include semantic elements. The files have been ordered to follow logical order. The repository contains original files in starter code, and required final mock in assessts "site-demo".

### Installation

NA

## Usage

The site displays correctly on 13 inch screens. When displayed on larger or smaller size windows or resized, the styles get messed up.
